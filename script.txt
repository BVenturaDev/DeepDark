"Hey!  Welcome to the caves!  Can you believe the government didn't want us to come down here?  They say it's not safe, nobody knows what's in here.  
I say how else are we supposed to learn? Amiright?  Besides think of all the resources we could find down here, I bet there is gold.  We technically aren't even supposed to have civilians like you down here,

If you ever get lost, remember you can follow your compass to the exit."
